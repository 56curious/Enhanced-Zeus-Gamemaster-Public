*PLEASE ENSURE THAT IT IS MADE CLEAR WHAT IS APART/NOT APART OF THE FRAMEWORK!*



Installing this framework :
(Ensure to credit, this doesn't require any specific map objects and can work, in theory, with any mod or mission file)

Step 1: Take the folder "Curious's Framework" and place it into the base directory of your mission file.
	The Folder stucture will now look like:
	missionNamespace\Curious's Framework

Step 2: Copy and paste the following files into the base directory of your mission file:
	initPlayerLocal.sqf
	initPlayerServer.sqf
	initServer.sqf
	init.sqf
	onPlayerRespawn.sqf
	stringtable.xml
	description.ext
	
	The directory will now look like:
	missionNamespace\_aboveFiles_

Step 3: Download "http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=19751" and place in the base directory. Follow
	any relevent documentation to ensure the view distance script works correctly.

Step 4 (Optional): If the above files are present, then you can just combine them together.
