<br /><font size='20'>Requested Everywhere Zeus Gamemaster Rule Set</font>
<br />
<br />
<br />Welcome to the Requested Everywhere Enhanced ZGM public server! We hope that you enjoy our server and everything it has to offer! if you wish to learn more, you can do so by reading the other notes.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />	1. When admin, do not abuse this. We do have undercover admins as well as a support framework code named 'WATCHDOG' that moniters the users. If it detects large numbers of player being kicked, the admin will be revoked and added on a cooldown, with a kick of course.
<br />
<br />	2. While we support the 'Double Power' issue of an admin also being in Zeus, an admin in the moderator slot monitering player is acceptable and encouraged if they do not wish to play on the ground.
<br />
<br />	3. We back the general rules of playing in a multiplayer environment, such as no spamming, general disruption of gameplay, disrespect of other players, teamkilling etc. If we feel you're out to remove the fun from others, we will deal with you.
<br />
<br />	4. Do not join the Zeus slot if you're in the blacklist. More information can be found in 'Gameplay Info'. (Feature coming soon)
<br />
<br />	5. Unit recruitment is allowed on this server, however we do ask that you don't abuse this, such as leaving members on solely for this. We do moniter the activity of players using 'WATCHDOG'.
<br />
<br />

<br /> Enjoy your stay, Requested Everywhere Administration.

<br />Our server uses a support framework by the name of 'WATCHDOG'. While we're not going to tell you everything it does, we will say it moniters player and server activity. This will include what was stated within the rules. The server itself is restarted every day at 1200 EST as this is the low-point for the majority of our player base.
<br />
<br />
<br />We do allow mods on this server, however they must be client-side. The current mod list we have approved and configured is:
<br /><font color='#d48421'>
<br />	1. JSRS Sound Mod (APEX)
<br />	2. Blastcore Edited (Standalone)
<br />	3. Shacktac HUD
<br />	4. Parts of ARES Achilles Expansion
<br /></font>
<br />These mods can also be loaded within the launcher when joining the server. It will also download them if they're missing.
<br />

<br />
<br />Within our mission file, we have lots of goodies under the hood to ensure that the Zeus and the players get the best experience possible from our server. While this is mostly focused on the Zeus, this in turn will effect the players too. For example, you're able to create an introduction to your mission by filling out our function creator with relevent information. Antoher feature we have is general maintenance, i.e view distance. This is currently in Beta and will require a server moderator or admin to open the menu for you.
<br />
<br />
<br />Because we have a customized Ares/Achilles mod on this server, there is the chance that you can execute scripts via the Zeus menu. However, there are a few steps to do this. First of all, you need to have gained the trust of moderators. Trolling to a point in which it ruins the server will obviously blacklist you from this, forever. However, If players and moderators can see you're trustworthy, then we will add you to a whitelist for the execute code module. All the scripts, including their return values, will be logged to the server so that we know if you have been attempting to collect data or mis-use this feature. If too many people abuse this however, then it will removed as a feature for as long as we see fit.
